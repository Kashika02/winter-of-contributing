Time Complexity : *Time complexity* in programming language means ,the number of times any program/algorithm/statement will be executed. 

Example : let's consider a 3 houses H1 ,H2 ,H3 respectively in a street, 
if i want to go to H1 , there are 3 ways :

          1: Crossing 2 houses H3, H2 and then arriving at H1.
          2: Directly going to H1.
          3: Crossing H2 and then going to H1.
          alot many ways....

       here , when we consider a program , there are number of ways to approach a solution,
       the best and the efficient way is always effective
All the approaches is right but the effective one , which took a lesser time to approach a solution , is considered the best.


Space Complexity : *Space complexity*, in programming language means , the amount of space any program/algorithm/statement would probably acquire.
